# SafeDrive
An Android application integrated with the SafeTrek API that enables automatic contact with emergency services in the case of an accident.

This app runs in the background as a notification, where it will continually monitor your accelerometer to detect possible car crashes.
If one is detected, it will contact the SafeTrek API and send emergency services to your location. 

Runs on Android 6.0 or later.
